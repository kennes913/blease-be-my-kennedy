            <p>
                Downtown Austin parking is notoriously difficult. We recommend saving yourself the stress (so you can enjoy the party!) and either taking a rideshare service from your hotel to and from the reception or parking at the Convention Center (rates are about $10-$15 for 6-7 hours), which is just a couple blocks away. If you're willing to put in the effort, you can always scour the block for street parking; however, there are often three-hour limits on street parking.

                 <p> Since the reception will go until 11PM, we recommend you book a place to stay nearby. Austin has a number of hotels downtown and the surrounding areas, as well as <a href=https://www.airbnb.com/s/Austin?guests=1&adults=1&children=0&infants=0&checkin=02%2F09%2F2017&checkout=02%2F12%2F2017&room_types%5B%5D=Entire%20home%2Fapt&ss_id=xn7rzii2&ss_preload=false&source=bb&page=1&s_tag=ivJcW6gF&allow_override%5B%5D=>Airbnb</a> options.
